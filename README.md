# CSS-Grid-project
Hi there,
today i made an Image gallery using CSS Grid .
CSS Grid is a very powerful 2 dimensional layout designing tool irrespective of flexbox which is one dimensional layout designing tool .

I created the layout of the image gallery by using css grid .

Using grid container properties -
1. grid-template-columns
2. grid-template-rows
3. gap
4. grid-auto-flow:dense
5. justify-content
6. justify-items
7. align-content
8. align-items
9. autofill/autofit
10. minmax()

Grid items properties -
1. grid-column
2. grid-row
3. place-self:align-self justify-self

and there are many other properties that you will know when you will make projects .

In this project i added a preloader and when you hover over the image you see a beautiful transition ( Night to Morning transition ). 
You can also add transitions in your projects . Transitions like skew,rotate,translate,scale ...

See the output here - [Image Gallery](https://anjali-git-hub.github.io/CSS-Grid-project/ "CSS GRIDS")
